          <p class="body-2 centered paragraph-1">This project started with an assumtion of having only one kind of users which was the online shopper. After while we have noticed that we have another very important user which is user #1 from the national institutions. We have lost this user multiple times because we did not put enough research into this user’s needs. Our wholesale bussines grew the fastest and we are getting overwelmed by orders through emails. We have to create easier way how automitaze this process. While focusing on the online shopper (#4) we started to notice a new behavior and the user #2 was boren. Now we focuse on all users equaly and want to create more delightful experience and of course bring more bussines. </p>
